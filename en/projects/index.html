				<p class="text">In Bizjapan, members engage with their interests in the form of “projects.”</p>
				<p class="text">“Projects” are done in various ways. Sometimes it can be hosting a workshop aimed towards people outside the community or an event co-hosted with companies. On the other hand it can be a study tour involving many associations or providing workshops exclusively for our members. The driving force of initiating projects  is not a simple “what to do” but rather an intensive process of thinking “what kind of society is ideal for us to live in”. Each project focuses on creating and carrying out their plans to realize it. </p>
				<p class="text">In Bizjapan, every member can initiate a project.  They start a project to channel their interests and awareness towards social issues. Bizjapan, full of drilling insights and diversity, has always been holding unique projects covering various disciplines. Many of which are investigating space medicine, providing job hunting support for international students, fostering global interaction through Sado, conducting R&D of pizza ovens and in data science, providing internships for those with low educational attainment, increasing awareness towards Chinese companies, discovering a new self-sufficient Africa, and many more.</p>

						During the tour, approximately 5~10 medical students will visit doctors who are active in the field of space medicine, and then listen to their lectures and discuss their accomplishments as well as career path. The professionals we will meet include astronauts, basic researchers, and flight surgeons. Not only that, we will visit special facilities and undergo exercises provided exclusively for this program. By doing so, medical students will get hands-on experience about space medicine and open up their eyes towards a whole new world.
						The 1st study tour was held on Spring 2018 and enjoyed favorable reputation. The 2nd tour will be held on Summer 2018. This program will be held regularly.</p>

During the initial 3 days in Tokyo, participants received a lecture on Japanese entrepreneurship after World War II by Seiichiro Yonekura, an honorary professor of Hitotsubashi University, and listened to a panel discussion on regional revitalization by NPOs and companies involved. They also deepened their understanding on Japanese technology through a visit to the National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology.  On day 4 and 5, participants visited Sakura City in Tochigi prefecture, and collaborated with local organizations in fieldwork on the current situation in rural areas. On day 6 and 7, they made group presentations on service and product solutions they had come up with to tackle problems in rural areas of Japan. Through the 7-day program, participants learned the first two steps of being a Change Maker, which is 1. Identifying the issue, and 2. Creating a solution (with the last step being implementation of the solution)
